        <img id="img_1" src="Head_Shot_1.jpg" alt="head_shot_1" align="right"></a><span>Greetings</span><span>,</span><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After successfully obtaining my first bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.fau.edu/">Florida Atlantic University</a> in business with a double major in management and marketing, I spent many years in the service industry where most of my career has been in the restaurant industry. In addition, I also had the pleasure of experiencing a period managing in the vehicle rental industry with Enterprise-Rent-A-Car. Even though I took pride in my work and did a great job, I never really felt satisfied with what I was doing in my career. I have a very analytical, problem solver, thinker type mind, and the majority of my day to day entailed mostly being social and maintaining goodwill with people. It was mostly wonderful, but the innate desire I have to utilize my mind was not ever fully satisfied. <a href="Joshua_Gardner_Project_1_Page_2.html"> <br><br><span>Career path evolution</span></a><br><br>
