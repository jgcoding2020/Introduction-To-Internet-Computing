My cousin was a senior web developer in New York and had been in the industry for several years so I called him to see if he had any advice to help me narrow down what to do next. We talked for a couple hours, and he gave me a run down of the various options I would have to enter the computer programming field. Longer story made a little bit shorter, I decided to return to college for a second baccalaureate in computer science, and here I am a couple years later. I love everything there is to love about computers, have many interests within the field including web development, AI, machine learning, data science, and currently my primary interest is pursuing a career in software engineering with my favorite high level language being C++.<a href="Joshua_Gardner_Project_1_Page_4.html"> <br><br><span>Hobbies &amp; Interests</span></a><br><br>
