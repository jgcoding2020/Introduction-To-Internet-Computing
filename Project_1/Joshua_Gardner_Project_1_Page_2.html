I concluded that learning what my true passion was and finding a place to use my mind within it, where I would fit, would be ideal. I felt free, I was single with no children and had nothing tying me down. I could go anywhere, do anything, and be whatever I had the desire to be. I found myself free of any negative energy, feeling peaceful. I began allowing every field of work to flow through my consciousness rapidly, and when my mind crossed paths with computers and technology my heart jumped. I felt emotionally driven. This was the answer I needed to find. I immediately grabbed my phone and started googling various careers in the tech industry to find a place where I truly felt would utilize my strengths. <a href="Joshua_Gardner_Project_1_Page_3.html"> <br><br><span>Path to Computer Science</span></a><br><br>
